# Smartphone-Price-Prediction

**Smartphone Price Prediction Using Machine Learning**

This project implements a machine learning model for predicting smartphone price categories (low cost, medium cost, high cost, very high cost) based on their technical specifications. 

**Key Features:**

* Utilizes the XGBoost classification algorithm for accurate price prediction.
* Performs data cleaning and imputation to handle missing values.
* Employs exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand feature distributions and relationships.
* Provides clear and documented code for each step of the machine learning pipeline.
* Offers the option for hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.

**Getting Started**

1. **Prerequisites:**
    * Python 3.x
    * Necessary libraries (refer to `requirements.txt` file for a list)
    * Training and test data files (`train - train.csv` and `test - test.csv`)

2. **Installation:**
    * Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/<your_username>/smartphone-price-prediction.git`
    * Navigate to the project directory: `cd smartphone-price-prediction`
    * Install required libraries: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

3. **Running the Project:**
    * Execute the main script: `predict_script.py`

**Project Structure:**

* `README.md`: This file (you're currently reading it!).
* `data/`: Folder containing training and test data (if applicable).
* `src/`: Folder containing the source code for the project (e.g., `predict_script.py`, `data_cleaning.py`, etc.).
* `requirements.txt`: Text file listing all required Python libraries for the project.

**Running the project**
* if you want to run the project edit 'predict_script.py' file with acual attributes for you smart device 
* the run in bash '$python predict_script.py' you will get the prediction price range for your model
